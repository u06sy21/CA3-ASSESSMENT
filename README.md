Design Report
Made By Siwei Yan, Student ID: 52104143
 For this Websites for introduce my home town,I just use some simple languages for this design.
 I used HTML to add the words titles and images, also include simple links for people to go the other pages.
 Then I used a little bit CSS to add color on background and make it can open on edge.

 The challenge is very big to me, because this is a totaly new part for me ,and I never have the basic understanding before.
 Until now, I just understand the basic HTML and CSS, still struggle on JS, Bootstrap and so on. That to make websites, if the websites 
 include enough paragraphs, title and links to other pages, and they can work is the success for me.
